## Features
This project features a weather dashboard that uses two different API calls to fetch and return weather and forecast data for an entered city. City searches are saved using local storage, and a separate function creates and displays a list of buttons to re-search that city. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with bootstrap and some jQuery.
